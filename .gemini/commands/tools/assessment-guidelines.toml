# Assessment Terminology Guidelines

Guidelines for accurately assessing learner progress without overstating skill levels.

## 🎯 Context

The learner is **actively learning** programming concepts through Boot.dev courses. They are:
- **Completing lessons** with test-driven learning
- **Applying patterns** they've just learned
- **Building understanding** through guided practice

They are **NOT**:
- Professional developers with years of experience
- Experts or masters in any technology
- Advanced practitioners

## ✅ APPROVED Terminology

### For Achievements:
- ✅ "**Completed successfully**" - Finished with passing tests
- ✅ "**Successfully implemented**" - Built working code
- ✅ "**Successfully applied**" - Used a pattern correctly
- ✅ "**Successfully built**" - Created functional solution
- ✅ "**Passed X/X tests**" - Concrete achievement metric

### For Capabilities:
- ✅ "**Can apply**" - Able to use a concept
- ✅ "**Can implement**" - Able to code a pattern
- ✅ "**Can create**" - Able to build from scratch
- ✅ "**Can write**" - Able to code independently
- ✅ "**Able to use**" - Has working knowledge

### For Understanding:
- ✅ "**Understands**" - Grasps the concept
- ✅ "**Solid understanding**" - Strong comprehension
- ✅ "**Good grasp**" - Comfortable with concept
- ✅ "**Strong grasp**" - Very comfortable
- ✅ "**Working knowledge**" - Practical understanding

### For Confidence:
- ✅ "**Good confidence level**" - Comfortable applying
- ✅ "**Strong confidence**" - Very comfortable
- ✅ "**Growing confidence**" - Improving comfort
- ✅ "**Solid confidence**" - Consistently applies well

### For Proficiency:
- ✅ "**Proficient**" - Competent, can work independently (use sparingly)
- ✅ "**Competent**" - Capable and reliable
- ✅ "**Developing proficiency**" - On path to proficiency

## ❌ FORBIDDEN Terminology

### Never Use These Terms:
- ❌ "**Mastery**" / "**Mastered**" - Implies years of experience
- ❌ "**Expertise**" / "**Expert**" - Reserved for industry professionals
- ❌ "**Advanced mastery**" - Double overstatement
- ❌ "**Expert level**" - Not appropriate for learners
- ❌ "**Achieved mastery**" - Passing one lesson ≠ mastery

## 📊 Assessment Examples

### ✅ CORRECT:
- "CH3-L3: Completed successfully with 4/4 test scores"
- "Successfully implemented FunctionDeclaration patterns"
- "Can apply Schema type patterns for STRING and ARRAY"
- "Solid understanding of Command Pattern"

### ❌ WRONG:
- "CH3-L3: MASTERED with perfect scores"
- "Achieved FunctionDeclaration mastery"
- "Schema type expertise achieved"
- "Command Pattern mastery"

## 🔍 Quality Checklist

Before submitting any assessment, verify:

1. [ ] No use of "mastery", "master", "mastered"
2. [ ] No use of "expert", "expertise", "expert-level"
3. [ ] All claims are evidence-based (test scores, working code)
4. [ ] Terminology reflects **learning stage**, not professional level
5. [ ] Focus on what learner **can do**, not what they've "mastered"

## 💡 Philosophy

**Remember**:
- Passing tests = **Understanding + Application**
- Understanding + Application ≠ **Mastery**
- Mastery = **Years of experience + Deep expertise**

**Goal**: Accurately track progress without inflating achievements.
