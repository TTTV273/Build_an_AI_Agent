## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Assessment Guidelines

**Review**: `.gemini/commands/tools/assessment-guidelines.toml` before creating commit messages.

**Key Rules**:
- ❌ NEVER use: "Mastered", "Expert", "Advanced mastery"
- ✅ ALWAYS use: "Completed", "Successfully applied", "Can now apply"

## Commit Process

1.  **Check Status**:
    -   Run the `git status` command to see the changed files (including the workflow, tool, and markdown documentation files just updated).

2.  **Stage Files**:
    -   Run the `git add .` command to add all changes to the staging area.

3.  **Create Commit Message**:
    -   Parse the input JSON string.
    -   Create a meaningful commit message in the Conventional Commits format, using the following template:

    ```
